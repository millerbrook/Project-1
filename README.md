Title: Relations between Marvel comic book creators and Marvel visual media

Members: Ian Castro, Candi Shanks, Brook Miller

Project Description and Outline:
Stan Lee is famously the lead creator of Marvel franchises. But Lee didn’t work alone. Were there particular creators working on the comic books who proved especially influential? That have lasting legacies, as demonstrated by inclusion in the Marvel cinematic universe and other visual media forms? We will consider these issues as well as the correlations between character success across media.

In this project we will analyze data from the Marvel universe and consider potential relationships. 
 
We will examine 2-3 APIs containing data about Marvel and focus upon the creators of the comic book versions of Marvel characters, and then on the appearance of Marvel characters in Marvel visual media.

Research Questions: 
Which are the most successful Marvel movies and television shows in the Marvel cinematic universe and other visual media?  
Is a specific comic book creator responsible for the majority of successful characters? Defining “success” as profit gained from movies and television shows, screen time, and number of appearances will be used as a metric of success. 

Null Hypothesis: No particular Marvel comic book writers had especially pronounced influence on the later Marvel cinematic universe and other visual media.
Hypothesis: There is a correlation between a specific comic book creator’s character and that character’s success in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Metrics: 
Grab characters and creator, find data on how many comic books does this character appear
Creators of comic book versions of characters
Series devoted to particular characters (comic books) and print runs
Number of appearances of characters in films and tv shows
Box office success of films
If possible:
Amount of screen time (Ex. Screen time Iron man vs Spider- man) 

Datasets:

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Decompose the problem
Examine and learn about each API & write request loops to pull appropriate data from each API
Run loops & Put data into DataFrame
Clean and merge  data
Visualize and Analyze Data
Make Observations regarding the tendencies we see
Create Presentation and Summary Documents and make Project accessible
